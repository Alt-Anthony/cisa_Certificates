ATTACK METODOLOGIES IN IT AND ICS

ANATOMY OF A CYBERATTACK


  ICS tools, high traffic scan or a failure can be signs that
  someone is attacking their system
  ICS TOOLS
  -Wireshark
  -Nessus
  More aggresive scan take less time but introduce a tremendous
  amount of traffic.
  ICS vs IT
  The time for scan IT systems will be shorter than ICS
  systems
  Dated information can be useful for an ICS attack
  Social Engineering, is the validation of collected data
  and it's relevance
 ATTACK PHASE
  Vulnerabilities and weaknesses to target for example:
  -Configuracion Management: leaving unneeded ports and 
   services can be a risk
  -Software and Security Updates: Security software can create
   high delays in systems.
  -Protocols: 
  Multi Pronged Attacks are made by using war dialing and war
  driving
  Vulnerability Information 

 INTRUSION PHASE
 MAINTAIN ACCESS is way for repeated access they might use
 open-source kits to modify system codes, install malware on
 hardware or on the system BIOS, they can survive a reboot,
 full system install or hard drive replacement
 Escalate Access, the attacker get ID and permission on the system
 Undetected Access,
