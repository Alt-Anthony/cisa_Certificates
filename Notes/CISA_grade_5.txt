CYBERSECURITY RISK
THREAT-VULNERABILITY-CONSEQUENCE

THREAT potential to someone to exploit a particular information
hacker, intentional attacks
 Attritbutes: Capability, Opportunity, Intent
 With these three attributes an attack will succeed.
 Some ides to stop:
  Incident responde plan
  Secure Credential Management
  No external network connections
  Use of the firewall
VULNERABILITY caused by an accident or exploited by an adversary
the adversary can cause great harm
Mitigate this vulnerabilites can be complex in ICS system
even aftter testing we must check the system to ensure the
mitigation is working
CONSEQUENCES financial loss and easy to calculate in IT systems
factors such as lost revenue, asset replacement, cost and cost
of the system, repair. With ICS in many cases other factors can
be consequences

ELEVATED RISK FACTORS
CULTURAL FACTORS in ICS include people or processes involved with
ICS, Now businesses require Isolated ICS to be safe
 People create process to stop cybersecurities, people can create
 vulnerabilities
TECHNICAL FACTORS in ICS with the acutal systems and components in
the system
 Interconnect Networks when ICS an IT are connected and if there 
 not protection, it creates a vulnerability
 Policies y Procedures  
 Vendors and the implementation of patches can make the system
 work in unexpected manner 
 Cybersecurity vulnerability such as Legacy devices and current
 devices
 Increasing Threats 

ICS/IT INTEGRATED
Mitigations: Speed, Detection, Intrusion, Resources, Compatibility
