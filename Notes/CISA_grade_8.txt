Impacts

EVENTS THAT CAN LEAD TO DISRUPTIONS
OPERATIONAL EVENTS
It can be mitigated with better engineering or proccess:
Kaizen or Sigma
 HARDWARE BREAKDOWNS
 SOFTWARE BUGS
 HUMAN ERROR
 FIELD DEVICE MALFUNCTION

NON-OPERATIONAL EVENTS 
outside of the control of the asset owner
 NATURAL EVENTS 
 SMALL ANIMALS 
 HACKERS

Data Integrity is crucial to make real-time decisions
Critical field equipement can have a detrimental impact 
Incorrect data could be worse than having no data

VIEW AND CONTROL
COMMAND AND CONTROL
OPEN-LOOP CONFIGURATION
Used in large scale,not time sensitive
CLOSED-LOOP CONFIGURATION
Must be continous and happen quickly, its almost only computer
Loss of View
The operator can see if the process is functioning
Loss of Control
