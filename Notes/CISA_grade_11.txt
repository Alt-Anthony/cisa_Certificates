NETWORK SECURITY LAYER OF DEFENSE
The third layer, can reduce the types of networks attacks
With the Purdue Enterprise Reference Architecture model or 
Purdue model, Cyber risk is reduced by defining critical network
paths, you can create data pathways into and out of specific levels
Security Technologies
It network defenses include security technologies and network management
These defenses are very common on IT networks, ICS networks are just
starting to deploy these defensive measures
External Connections
can be limitated and employ encriptation to protect data can use VPN

Perimeter Components
Only firewalls are deployed in ICS systems for the moment
IDS or Intrusion Detection System
 -NIDS detect anomalies in the network and can notify administrators
 -HIDS detect and log the modifications to files 
Intrusion Prevention System
Come in both forms 
UTM is less expensive and more used in small and mid business
Firewall Implementation 
the default configuration is deny all connections and all ports closed
IT DEPLOY FIREWALL
-1 vendor default rule set
-2 best practice rule sets
-3 Customize rule sets
-4 Apply rules
Firewall Diversity
Host and network based
Implementation
IDS/IPS
Setting up an IDS in an ICS is much easier than an IT enviroment
