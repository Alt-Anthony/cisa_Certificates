IDENTIFY VULNERABLE ELEMENTS IN AN ICS
Targets: any system,Integrated systems are vulnerable, and
more risk if connected to the control system network
Common vulnerabilities:
-Poor Code
-Vulnerable Web Services
-Poor Network Protocol Implementation
-Poor Patch Management
-Weak Authentication
-Least User Privileges Violation
-Information Disclosure
-Network Design
-Network Componenet Configurations

Discuss the Factors Contributing To ICS VULNERABILITIES
-Rapid information exchange limit security
-Real-Time accessibility to critical operations, use of 
remote access
-Direct access to the operational enviroment
FACTORS
-Pressure from Industry
Cut costs can be a disadvantage
-Technology Architecture
Use of cloud or TCP/IP	
-Remote Access
VPN

CAUSES OF ICS CYBER VULNERABILITIES
Legacy Control Systems
MIGRATION TO COTS introduces IT vulnerablities in ICS
