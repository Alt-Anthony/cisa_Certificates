DEFINE DEFENSE-IN-DEPTH
Create multiple layers of defense, Create countermeasures to protect vital assets
or areas that are know to be weak.
PEOPLE must be trained and aware of the security
TECHNOLOGY
OPERATIONS
LAYER APPROACH, developing defenses for all systems,
-security management
-physical security
-network security
-hardware security
-software security

BASELINE FOR DEFENDING ICS
-Recognize your baseline, documenting the baseline will
show progress when you make changes
-Understand your policies, some companies have "unwritten"
policies
-Implement your polices
-Identify all you ICS networks components
-Compare what you identified on your baseline
-Prioritize and make changes
-Star all over again
You can use to develop your baseline, the software called
Cyber Security Evaluation Tool(CSET)
 -The tool cannot fix the gaps it identifies, is responsibility
 of the user
 -Will no indicate if your answer are correct or incorrect

MANAGEMENT DEFENSE LAYER
Security Model
 Map Architecture, map the ICS architectures, an accurate and well
 documented architecture can help to deploy effective security
 countermeasures
 Risk Assesment is the procces of identifying the threat and his impact
 Digital Asset ID
 Profile Model, what type of protection is needed for each ICS component
 Identify/Remove Vulnerabilities
 Standardize Policies, 
 Incident Response, How the organization will respond to an incident,
 the tools for detecting the problem 
 Training,

Security Policy, Recomendations
Acceptable Use, Internet Policies and practices, Hiring qualifications
Change Management, Change Control
Access Control
Incident Response: 
-Preparation proactive phase,
-Identification
-Containment
-Clean-up&Recovery
-Follow-up
