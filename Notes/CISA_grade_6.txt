ICS CYBERSECURITY THREATS
can be intentional or unintentional, natural or man-made
HUMAN THREAT
person o threat actor will abandon the attack if the 
security is beyond his conditions
 Attributes: -Intent, the motive or goal, curiosity or money
 espionage, revenge or a cause
             -Capability, the resources to made the attack,
 the attacker must have enough information to perform the
 attack
    	     -Opportunity, the conditions for the enemy, to
 to be sure that the attack will be successful, about	
 vulnerabilites and exposure from the targets

Overtime the adversaries can acquire or create the capability
and oportunity, Unpredictable behavior creates situations
where static countermeasures may not be adequate

THREATS: Not Understood, Not predictable
Threat Actor Categories:
-Mainstream  is the largest threat group they want attention or
notoriety. generally not well organized
-Organized threats, generally targetin a group, they might
want revenge, money or attention for a cause, it can be 
a large and more organized group 
 -Terrorist/Nation State only want to eliminate, terrorize, they
go for military, gobern institution, or political places

Intentional vs Unintentional Cyber Threats
Discuss Threat Trends for ICS

HAZARDS: Predictable, Understood danger:
It can be posible to calculate when a system or device will
fall based in a historial.

Describe Attacker Tools and Techniques
First phase: RECONNAISANCE/TARGETING
Second phase: VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT
Third phase: ATTACK

MALWARE: 
Backdoors bypass authentication or remote access to a computer
Botnets: Large number of infected computers to generate spam or DoS
Ransomware: hold data or systems unitil you pay
RootKit maintain privileges access
Trojan malicious software hided in a program
Virus infect many files between computers
Worm replicate and travel across the network
ICS cybersecurity  
--New independent research
--Increasing number of disclosed vulnerabilities
--Asset owner requirements
--Vendor market differentiators
--More understanding about influence of ICS on critical infrastructure
--Increase in incident reports
--Increase in easy-to-use attack tools
