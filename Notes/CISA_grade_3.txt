DESCRIBE COMMON ICS COMPONENTS
each ICS function differently
SERVERS store configuration and saves process data for later
retrieval, allow remote control
ENGINEERING WORKSTATIONS a human-machine interface, modify
database or controllers
FIELD DEVICES are instruments, they control the process
with parameters they are called input devices too, output
devices are valves switches, they are the interface between ICS
and physical process
  INPUT
    DIGITAL sensors use a encoded ICS communications
    ANALOG use an analog signal such as 4 to 20MA
    DISCRETE support events like alarms and states
  OUTPUT
    DISCRETE can comunicate directly with input devices,
    they can make control decisions like a field controller
    ANALOG used to control actuators, valves and motors,
    send a signal to open or close
    DIGITAL control voltage, communicate more quickly
  
SAFETY SYSTEMS 	provide protection 

FIELD CONTROLLERS collect and process I/O data,process and 
command from the MHI  to field controllers, convert electric signals
to digital signals and do the same alreves
 REMOTE TERMINAL UNIT sometimes called remote telemetry unit
 relays information from a remote location using ICS protocols
 can execute programs even witohut an operator convert analog
 and discrete measurements to digital:
	-Oil and gas
	-refineries
	-water and wastewater
	-electric power
	-mine sites
	-transport system
 INTELLIGENT ELECTRONIC DEVICE used in energy sector, receive data from I/O
 PROGRAMMABLE LOGIC CONTROLLER can automate an entire production line
 	-Ladder logic
	-text structured
	-Diagrams
	-Function chart
	-iNstruction lists
 PROGRAMMABLE AUTOMATION CONTROLLER fits better with extensive
 process control requirements, provide a more open architecture
 easy to understand it can be used for communicating monitoring and control
 various networks and devices 
 HUMAN MACHINE INTERFACE present a graphical user interface for real time
 view of the process is an obvious target for attacks 

HMI previosuly called MMI, comes in two forms, a touch panel
or a software aplication

FIELD DEVICES 		FIELD CONTROLLER	HMI
Meters,sensors,		PLC,PAC,RTU,IED		workstations
valves,switches		logic controller,	SCADA SERVER, emergency
			Automation controller,	EMERGENCY SYSTEM
			Remote termina unit,
			electronic device

IDENTITFY ICS TYPES
 SCADA supervisory control and data acquisition, analyze real time
 data used to controll dispersed assets, its a risk for cyberattacks
 use a master controller to comunicate
 
 DISTRIBUTED CONTROL SYSTEMS or DCS deployed inside the control area
 can have multiple controllers dividing tasks even if one part of the
 DCS fails the control area can continue 

 SCADA is data-gathering oriented and DCS is process oriented

 PROCESS CONTROL SYSTEM OR PCS similar to SCADA but perform many
 functions as DCS, communicate using a plant network

DISCUSS DATA FLOW WHITHIN AN ICS
 process data control the measurements, can be also used to
 track costs,provide design, requirements
PROCESS FLOW
 CONTROL LOOP fundamental to build ICS, regulate the process
 can be fully automated or include human control
 DIAGRAM operated by human or EMS or DCS 
 CASCADING CONTROL 
 DATA FLOW field controllers transmit the data to HMI to
 station in time real
Network communication by ICS varies like Vendor,Protocols and Topology
Process data Flow, Temperature, Pressure

RECOGNIZE ICS COMMUNICATION TOPOLOGIES, METHODS, AND PHYSICAL MEDIA
RS232 is still used for ptp communications
 BUS TOPOLOGY single cable everyone know that a transmission is 
 ocurring
 RING TOPOLOGY constructed from a closed loop cable communicate
 between a token 
 STAR TOPOLOGY is central device t communicate send the data to the central
 device
 Master Field Controller relation critical controllers are polled twice
 a second, a master can communicate with one or more field
 Physical Media 
  Leased Lines dedicated communication circuits, useful for remote but not
  available in all areas
  Wired Media fiber and copper lines or wired media they are fast and reliable
  but is vulnerable to cyberattack
  WIFI common in local operations
  Radio frecuency used in site facility or plant operations
  Microwave and cellular faster but expensive
 
DISCUSS COMMON PROTOCOLS USED IN ICS
 COMMUNICATION CHANNELS follow from one device to another, can be a wire or logical
 its defined by protocols also include mechanisms for how the devices manage the
 connections. Field devices, controller and HMI USE these protocols.
 Common protocols
 Modbus oldest and most popular, simple and openness. for two or more devices
 use TCP/IP protocols, is a master/slave architecture
  Versions 
   ASCII Original easy to resolve
   PLUS RS485
   RTU use binary form more efficient than ASCII
   TCP/IP based on Ethernet
  Authentication and authorization is required
  Vulnerabilities 
 DNP3 or Distributed Network Protocol 3 used in SCADA and remote systems
 used in support communication across the world, not provide for authentication
 or authorization, Acts as Outstaion for the Master, also as Master of Outstation
 Three layers contained within the aplication Data Link Layer, Transport Layer,
 Application Layer.
 ICCP or Inter-Control Center Communications Protocol for real-time data excahnge
 also provides services for data transfer, depending on the type of request.
  Security standard is insecure 
 FIELDBUS collections of protocols, permits various topologies, can be bi-directional
 multi-drop, serial-bus.
  Levels 4 data monitoring at large scale, level 3 data communication, level
  2 complexity scale, level 1 isolated field devices
 There are two sections to the fieldbus, Interconnection and application 
 PROFIBUS designed for I/O in factory and automation, devices connect to a central
 line, Only one master can control the bus.
 There are three types of PROFIBUS: FMS(FieldBus Message Specification), Profibus DP,
 Profibus PA, the first is used for data acquisition, the second for fast communications
 the third when the security is the most important.
 OPEN PLATFORM COMMUNICATION(OPC) is the most versatile in the industry, is a client/server based
 communication, more servers for more clients, the client is who decide all the operations
 CLASSIC SPECIFICATION and UNIFIED ARCHITECTURE 
 the biggest difference is UA doenst rely in technologies making it possible to implement
 on any platfoorm also can use models and structures
 OPC is popular for simplify the protocol without the need for an ICS vendor, it can support any protocol
