SECURE SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT
ICS must operate in high-availability, high-capacity but is quite difficult
PHYSICAL SECURITY prevents unauthorized access to locations, remote access can be
a risk, ics assets protect, integrate corporate and control system network
CHANGE MANAGEMENT
1- The change can not impact the system in a negative way
2-The time for the change
After changes, it has to be tested it can be a long and expensive process
IT AND ICS SUPPORTS
Anti-Virus and Anti-Malware, IT domain: they are very popular, 
ICS SYSTEMS VIEW
they can run antivirus-software
Antivirus technology can consume significant processing capacity
Operations may not perform properly
You can obtain manually antivirus
PACTH MANAGEMENT
ICS systems dont have many patches, IT systems get patches as soon as they
released
ICS assets owners must decide about patches to be implemented,
Even with isolation there are still risks
SUPPORT PERSONNEL
the human error, untrained operators
ICS consecuences can be more impactful than IT consequences
