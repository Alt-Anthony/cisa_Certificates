IT AND ICS SECURITY
new risk: worms viruses, unauthorized remote access
GOALS: C-I-A C is the main concern in security controls for business
In control system enviroment, A and I are superior
An ICS enviroment must always be avaliable and C is not the primary
goal
DETERMINISM
IT systems generate network traffic on demand when there is a request
or maintenance, repeatable, predictable and designed
INTERNET ACCESS
ICS components are operated in an isolated environment
Maintain and support systems
Enable vendors to provide support and updates
HOST APPLICATION
In IT applications are used to support the diverse requirements of the
organization
In ICS only to monitor and control process
SECURITY /CIKR COMPILANCE
Major role ICS
NERC/CIP to protect cyber assets
SECURE SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT
ICS must operate in high-availability, high-capacity but is quite difficult
PHYSICAL SECURITY prevents unauthorized access to locations, remote access can be
a risk, ics assets protect, integrate corporate and control system network
CHANGE MANAGEMENT
1- The change can not impact the system in a negative way
2-The time for the change
After changes, it has to be tested it can be a long and expensive process
IT AND ICS SUPPORTS
Anti-Virus and Anti-Malware, IT domain: they are very popular, 
ICS SYSTEMS VIEW
they can run antivirus-software
Antivirus technology can consume significant processing capacity
Operations may not perform properly
You can obtain manually antivirus
PACTH MANAGEMENT
ICS systems dont have many patches, IT systems get patches as soon as they
released
ICS assets owners must decide about patches to be implemented,
Even with isolation there are still risks
SUPPORT PERSONNEL
the human error, untrained operators
ICS consecuences can be more impactful than IT consequences
SECURITY TESTING
Testing can reveal system risks and countermeasures, It focus on C-I-A
ICS testing can be a disadvantage, test for ICS should be performed in a
sandbox
INCIDENT RESPONSE
OUTSOURCING 
IT services are more easier than ICS
